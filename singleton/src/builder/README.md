In builder pattern Problem starts when an object can be created with lot of parameters, some of them may be mandatory and others may be optional. Consider a class which is used to create Cake, now you need number of item like egg, milk, flour to create cake. many of them are mandatory and some  of them are optional like cherry, fruits etc. If we are going to have overloaded constructor for different kind of cake then there will be many constructor and even worst they will accept many parameter.
